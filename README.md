# NIR

This repository provides information collected from several Translink -
Northern Ireland Rail sources and provides information about each
station visible on the [Translink Real Time Rail Stations Arrivals and
Departures API](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/real-time-rail-stations-arrivals-and-departures)

## Issues
- There seem to be differences between the CRS codes from the locations
  data provided by Translink for the rail timetable system (used in this
repository) and the codes used as part of the Real Time API.
